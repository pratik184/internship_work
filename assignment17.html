Hundreds of readers sent comments about the first edition, and many more sent individual comments about the second edition. Thanks to everyone who took time to share their reactions to the book in its various forms. 
Special thanks to the Construx Software reviewers who formally inspected the entire manuscript: Jason Hills, Bradey Honsinger, Abdul Nizar, Tom Reed, and Pamela Perrott. I was truly amazed at how thorough their review was, especially considering how many eyes had scrutinized the book before they began working on it. Thanks also to Bradey, Jason, and Pamela for their contributions to the cc2e.com website.
